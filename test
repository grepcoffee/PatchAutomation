ABC Automation harnesses the power of AWS Config aggregators coupled with IAM organizational permissions to seamlessly compile resources from every account within our organization. We leverage the AWS read-only role, strategically positioned within the master accounts. In addition, we integrate Lambda functions with leading CSPM tools such as Prisms, CrowdStrike, and Qualys to obtain insights into account status and ensure compliance with our stringent security policies and configurations. For comprehensive reporting and tracking, we source data from Archer, our trusted GRC tool, ensuring clarity on account ownership and providing streamlined escalation paths when necessitated by security findings.
